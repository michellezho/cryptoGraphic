Based on cryptography and network P2P technology, Cryptocurrencies are generated by computer programs, and then issued and circulated on the Internet. Bitcoin is regarded as the world’s first and currently the most dominant digital cryptocurrency. According to the report from cryptocurrency tracker CoinGecko, the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies is $2.36 trillion, while the total market capitalization of bitcoin is $900 billion by the end of 2021. There are only 16 countries in the world with a GDP larger than Bitcoin (BTC) market value. 1.2 Why crypto? Unlike tradition stocks, cryptocurrencies are not backed by any assets or cash flow, the only thing driving their prices is sentiment-driven speculation. As sentiment changes, prices can change dramatically. Due to the nature of cryptocurrency, it has some advantages over traditional stocks. Availability - Crypto can be used as long as the user has internet or mobile access. Thanks to this, we can pay for products and services all over the world without having to convert currency to country-specific currency. No Commissions - When paying with cryptocurrencies, first of all, we avoid banks and intermediaries, so we do not incur commissions and fees for servicing bank accounts. The cryptocurrencies system is based on P2P (Peer-to-Peer), i.e. no intermediaries. Anonymity - we can pay primarily in cryptos for transactions we wish to be anonymous. No Inflation - Cryptos are created on the so called defense mechanism against inflation by setting a maximum amount of cryptos and the inability to increase it. 1.3 Why not Crypto? On the contrary, cryptocurrencies also have many obvious disadvantages. Risks - The exchange rate of cryptocurrencies is very volatile. No Control - Cryptos are not regulated by financial and state institutions, and there is no central bank. Speculative Bubble - Many critics of cryptos argue that their exchange rates are driven by the enthusiasm of internet users and do not determine the crypto’s true value. Anonymity - This feature is both an advantage and disadvantage of cryptocurrencies. Criminals can use cryptocurrencies to fund illicit interests. Irreversibility of transactions - if we order a transfer to the wrong address, the transaction will not be refunded. There is also no reason for us to demand the return of cryptos. 1.4 Our goal Based on the characteristics of cryptocurrency, we have raised several basic questions. How many cryptocurrencies are there in the market? What are their historical prices and valuations? Why are cryptocurrencies suddenly so popular? And after having the basic idea of the cryptocurrencies, we want try to doing some research on the following questions. Explore the development trend of cryptocurrencies from the market cap and their public attention. Show how the cryptocurrencies are different from traditional financial derivatives by comparing their behavior when affected by the positive or negative factor under the same time period. What factors are related to the price of cryptocurrencies? Rather than modeling, we will apply an exploratory data analysis on this question.

For traditional stocks, due to the limitation of trading dates, OHLCV data on non-trading dates will be missing compared to cryptocurrencies, and we choose to use previous data to fill in. We will try to figure out the problem using the daily adjusted closing price of Bitcoin and NASDAQ 100 from 2016 to 2021, here is the sample of our origin data. ## BTC.USD.Adjusted NDX.Adjusted ## 2015-12-31 430.566986 4593.270020 ## 2016-01-01 434.334015 NA ## 2016-01-02 433.437988 NA ## 2016-01-03 430.010986 NA ## 2016-01-04 433.091003 4497.859863 Here we plot the missing values in year 2016. Only NDX.Adj contains the missing value, and the proportion of missing row is approximately 30%, which is consistent with the proportion of the non-trading days of a year(1-252/365).

Google Trend 5.4 Google Trend v.s State 5.5 related query", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Market Cap We want to compare the market cap of the traditional stocks with the cryptos, so we get the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Full Cap Index at the end of each month as the measurement of the market cap of the traditional stocks and make the following plot. The market cap of the cryptos and traditional stocks basically follow the same trend in recent years, while the market cap of the cryptos expanded more rapidly. This leads us to the next question, what cryptos dominate the trend and how the internal structure of cryptocurrencies has changed. From the previous plot we know that The market capitalization ratio of cryptocurrencies has changed dramatically over the past few years. From the market cap mosaic plot we can find out that the total market cap of cryptocurrencies expand rapidly in year 2017 and The plot above shows the progress of crypto’s market capitalization over the recent years. it is interesting to see that in the early years ADA and XRP shared a significant amount of crypto’s market capitalization. As Bitcoin has grown in popularity over the years, its market cap has increased many times over. However, in 2021 more and more other new cryptocurrency emerged and many new cryptos other than traditional ones, like BTC, ETH and XRP , had a significant market capitalization. 5.2 Price v.s Price OHLCV is an aggregated form of market data standing for Open, High, Low, Close and Volume. OHLCV data includes 5 data points: the Open and Close represent the first and the last price level during a specified interval. High and Low represent the highest and lowest reached price during that interval. From our data source(Yahoo Finance), we can get the daily OHLCV data of each cryptocurrency and traditional stocks. So in this chapter, we want to explore the price changing relationship between traditional stocks and cryptocurrencies. 5.2.1 Among Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP are top three cryptocurrencies with the highest market cap at the end of 2021, so we choose these three coins to represent cryptos. We will use their daily closing price between 2018 and 2021 to explore their relationship. In order to show the closing price relationship among different cryptos more clearly, we have do some scaled transformation on data. From the Feature Cryptocurrencies Daily Closing Price plot, we can clearly find out that there is significant relationship among each crypto’s daily closing price. We also find out the relationship seems changed in 2020. To dig deeper on their relationship, we generate a pair scatter plot and colored the data point by the year. The pairs scatter plot give us very interesting result that these three cryptos’ daily closing price basically follows linear relationship with each other and the slope of the linear relationship line is changed at the begining of 2020. Before 2020, XRP closing price is higher than that after 2020 with the same ETH or BTC price. We can conclude from the pair plot that before 2020, XRP is overvalued. And after 2020, BTC may be overvalued. 5.2.2 Cryptos v.s stocks Nowadays, cryptocurrencies have also become an investment target. Therefore, cryptocurrencies have replaced the status of traditional investment targets to a some extent.So we want to explore the relationship between the closing price of cryptocurrencies and the closing price of traditional stocks. We will use NASDAQ 100 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average as the measurement of the pricing change of the traditional stocks. We will use BTC and XRP to represent cryptos as based on the discussion above, they basically represent two stage of crypto’s pricing change. From the plot we can conclude that both the cryptocurrency, represented by Bitcoin and ETH, and the traditional financial assets, represented by the Nasdaq 100 index and DJI, their financial yield sequence of have the characteristics of peaks and thick tails, and the rate of return and volatility of encrypted cryptocurrency is greater after 2020. 5.3 Price v.s. Google Trend Social media and news play an important role in driving the fluctuation of economic indicators and financial markets in a nontrivial fashion. Therefore, it is not surprising that the rapid development of cryptocurrency has attracted increasing attention from news and social media. In this part, we introduce Google trend as the measurement and perform preliminary data exploratory method to discuss its relationship with cryptos(BTC) pricing change. The plot shows that there is a certain lag between the popularity on social media and the daily return of cryptocurrencies. Generally, the Google Trend index will increase significantly a few days after days when Bitcoin fluctuated violently. 5.4 Google Trend v.s State Who are more interested in cryptos? This is also an interesting questions, as the transactions of Cryptocurrency are anonymous, we cannot obtain information about traders. So we will use Google Trend Index to get the demography characters of the people who are interested in cryptos. It is understandable that states such as California, Washington, and New York , which are economically developed, and where the Internet and financial companies gather, show a high interest in Bitcoin. But it’s surprisingly to see that people in Nevada are the most ardent fan of Bitcoin. By searching some information, we believe this result is due to Nevada’s easing policy on cryptocurrencies. Nevada became the first state to ban local governments from taxing blockchain use when it enacted Senate Bill No. 398, which established various provisions relating to the use of blockchain technology. 5.5 related query What else would people who follow Bitcoin search for? We plot the following word cloud to visualize it. ‘Stock’ and ‘Ethereum’ are most related, which also confirms our previous theory, that cryptocurrencies have strong correlations with each other and with traditional stocks.
